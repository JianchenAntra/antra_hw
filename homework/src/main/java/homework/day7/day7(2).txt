In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. 
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. ... 
A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement.

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. 
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

A view is limited to whatever can be expressed in a single SELECT statement (well, possibly with CTEs and a few other tricks), but in general, a view is tied to declarative forms of queries. 
A stored procedure on the other can use various procedural type constructs (as well as declarative ones), and as a result, using SPs, one can hand-craft a way of solving a given query which
 may be more efficient than what SQL-Server's query optimizer may have done (on the basis of a single declarative query).
  In these cases, an SPs may be much faster (but beware... the optimizer is quite smart, and it doesn't take much to make an SP much slower than the equivalent view.)
  
  
  
  The basic difference between View and Materialized View is that Views are not stored physically on the disk. ... View can be defined as a virtual table created as a result of the query expression. However, 
  Materialized View is a physical copy, picture or snapshot of the base table.
