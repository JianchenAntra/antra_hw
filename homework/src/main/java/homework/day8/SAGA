The SAGA Pattern
A saga pattern is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service. The first transaction in a saga is initiated by an external request corresponding to the system operation, and then each subsequent step is triggered by the completion of the previous one.

One of the most well-known patterns for distributed transactions is called Saga. The first paper about it was published back in 1987 and sagas have been a popular solution since then.
